Here I designed a robotic arm capable of doing rotational and prismatic motions. utilizing a combination of stepper motors and servo motors controlled by an ESP32 microcontroller. This project features a mobile web application that allows users to control the armâ€™s movements, including prismatic motion, base rotation, link rotation, and gripper actions.




Features
- Prismatic Motion: Controlled by Stepper Motor 1 to extend or retract the arm.
- Base Rotation: Controlled by Stepper Motor 2 to rotate the entire arm base.
- Link Rotation: Controlled by Servo Motor 1 to adjust the angle of the arm's link.
- End Effector Control: Controlled by Servo Motor 2 to open and close the gripper.
- Mobile Web Application: Allows remote control of the arm via a mobile phone. Users can send commands to move the arm and adjust angles.
